### Introduction

**React Performance Devtool** is a Chrome extension for inspecting the performance of React Components. It statistically examines the performance of React components based on the measures which are collected by React using `window.performance` API.

This project started with a purpose of extending the work done by [Will Chen](https://github.com/wwwillchen) on a proposal for React performance table. You can read more about it [here](https://github.com/facebook/react-devtools/issues/801#issuecomment-350919145).

### Uses

* Remove or unmount the component instances which are not being used.

* Inspect what is blocking or taking more time after an operation has been started.

* Examine the table and see for which components, you need to write [shouldComponentUpdate]() lifecycle hook.

* Examine which components are taking more time to load.
